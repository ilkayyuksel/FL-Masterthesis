Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in Distributed Systems

This thesis aims to investigate the application of federated learning for intrusion detection in distributed systems. The main goal is to design and develop a federated learning system that can effectively detect and prevent intrusions while maintaining the privacy and security of the data. The system will be trained and evaluated using academic benchmark datasets. This thesis will also explore the generalisation strength of the federated learning approach and compare the results against a centralized approach.
